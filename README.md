# Codecademy-Mixed-Messages
 
## About Project 
This is a portfolio JavaScript Project on compeletion of module 7 in Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Path.
This  project required us to generate random message whenever it is run bby the user.

## Thought Process

1.Created an Array of Objects called qoutes and each object have qoute and author property.

2.Copied 8 qoutes to make 8 objects of this array.

3. Used Math.random() and Math.Floor to generate random number between 0 & length of Array -1.

4.Used Template Literal to print qoute on to the console.

## What is next 

1.Till Now I have not done DOM, so I didn't created UI for this project. But in coming time, I will create UI
for this project using HTML, CSS and JS.

2.After studying about API's, I use a qoute API to generate random message and print it on a webpage.
