# Codecademy-Mixed-Messages
 
## About Project 
This is a portfolio JavaScript Project on completion of module 7 in Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Path.
This project required us to generate random message whenever it is run by the user.

## Thought Process

1.Created an Array of Objects called quotes and each object have quote and author property.

2.Copied 8 quotes to make 8 objects of this array.

3. Used Math. random() and Math.Floor to generate a random number between 0 & length of Array -1.

4.Used Template Literal to print quote onto the console.

## What is next 

1.Till Now I have not done DOM, so I didn't create UI for this project. But in the coming time, I will create UI for this project using HTML, CSS and JS.

2.After studying API's, I use a quote API to generate a random message and print it on a webpage.
